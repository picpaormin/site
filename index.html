            Accountants (PICPA)</a> is the national professional accountancy body of the Philippines. Explorers with an
            accounting background first formed the PICPA in November 1929. The PICPA focuses on four areas of practice
            for a CPA: Public Practice, Commerce and Industry, Education, and Government.</p>

        <h2>Theme of the year.</h2>
        <img src="images/picpa-theme.png" alt="PICPA Theme Logo">
        <p>The environment in which PICPA operates is changing rapidly.</p>
        <p>All businesses and organizations, including PICPA, understand the changes, both natural and inevitable.</p>
        <p>PICPA members are realizing that the skills and capabilities needed today are vastly different from those of
            five years ago. Unless PICPA transforms with the times, there is a very real risk that the organization may
            become entrenched in securing the ship with traditional operating structures instead of taking advantage of
            emerging technologies and innovation.</p>
        <p>PICPA as an organization needs to be open and willing to embrace new ways of doing things in order to fortify
            its relevance to its members, the Filipino accountants, and the accountancy profession as a whole. It needs
            to transform with resiliency, agility, and innovation. </p>
        <p class="collapsible__content">Resiliency reflects our strength and ability to recover from challenges.</p>
        <p class="collapsible__content">Agility demonstrates our ability to move quickly and react, positively to
            disruptions.</p>
        <p class="collapsible__content">Innovation is our willingness to accept and embrace new ideas, processes, and
            technologies to find better
            solutions.</p>
        <p class="collapsible__content">By being resilient, agile, and innovative, we are better able to take advantage
            of the opportunities.</p>
        <p class="collapsible__content">By building on our transformative capabilities, we are able to dynamically shift
            our strength and focus
            in order to seize these opportunities and create greater value.</p>
        <p class="collapsible__content">By transforming, we are able to better shape and hone the PICPA of the future
            that is able to respond to
            the needs of all its stakeholders.</p>
        <p class="collapsible__content">These aspirations led the 2021-2022 PICPA Leadership to adopt the theme
            “TRANSFORM, Embracing
            Possibilities, Realizing Potentials” to direct and accelerate their actions towards the realization of
            PICPA’s mission
            and vision, all for the purpose of providing the common good.</p>
        <p class="collapsible__content">With this theme, the new PICPA leadership also designed a theme logo that
            encapsulates the theme's value
            proposition. The PICPA theme logo is depicted by a stylized swoosh which symbolizes agility, innovation,
            power, and
            motivation.</p>
        <p class="collapsible__content">The word “TRANSFORM” is aptly superimposed, taking on the colors of PICPA that
            symbolized calmness amid
            uncertainties and resilience in the face of adversities.
            The four chevrons of PICPA logo, representing the four sectors of the profession, interlocked at the
            center to form the letter “S”, denoting their solidarity in pursuing initiatives to strengthen the relevance
            and competitive advantage of PICPA and its members.</p>
        <p class="collapsible__content">The vibrant pixels emanating from the PICPA logo embody the dynamic and
            aggressive transformation that
            PICPA and its members must espouse and live through to be able to turn uncertainties into possibilities and
            opportunities, thereby unlocking and realizing their full potential for growth and sustainability even
            during difficult and challenging times.</p>
        <p class="collapsible__content">PICPA challenges us to transform and brace all possibilities and realize our
            potentials. This is an
            urgent call. We must respond or we will fall behind.</p>
        <p class="collapsible__content">This is our guiding principle, our advocacy, our theme. “TRANSFORM: Embracing
            possibilities, Realizing
            potentials”.</p>
